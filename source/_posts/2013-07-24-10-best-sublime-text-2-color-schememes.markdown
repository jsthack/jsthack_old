Below is a list that I compiled from testing about 200 different Sublime Text Color Schemes for the past couple months. If you are a dark text on light background user then this is not the list for you. As a designer I want my color scheme to do what it ment to do, and that is improve usability, legibility, and workflow. These schemes below get out of their own way, and let your content shine.
