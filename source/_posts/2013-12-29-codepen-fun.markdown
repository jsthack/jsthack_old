###What Is It?###
Below is a great example of two really interesting products, coming together in perfect harmony. Most of you probably know of CodePen if your in the web dev scene. It's this really great little web app that allows you to create and test little snippets of code, and they are rendered live on the page. CodePen supports most of the new web standards. It's supports HTML5, CSS3, LESS, SASS, SCSS, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and LiveScript. It really is a great tool if you want to quickly start writing code and work through a problem with out having to set up a file structure, and a localhost for previewing. It was created by well known front-end designer Chris Coyier, Tim Sabat, and Alex Vazquez. Check it out!.

###Embedding Pens###
sharing your pens is super easy witht he embed builder. They created this easy to use, and customizable interface to help you embed you pens. You can change the style of your pen, and choose from a bunch of other settings. It then just gives you some code to include in your markup, and your good to go.
