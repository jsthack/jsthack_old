Google's web font library has become quite exstensive, with almost 700 different font families. If you aren't familier with Google Web Fonts or other webfont sources like Typekit, the way it works is with an API. It's very simple to use Google's Web Fonts. You first choose the font that you want to use, google will then give you a snippet of code as shown below.
{% codeblock lang:html %}
<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Typehead,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
{% endcodeblock %}
All you have to do after that is insert that snippet into the head tag in your html document. After this is done you can start using the font in your designs by simply specifying it in your CSS like any other local font.
{% codeblock lang:css %}
#nav { 
    font-family: 'Typehead', sans-serif, verdana;
    font-size: 15px;
    line-height: 5px;
    color: #003c42;
}
{% endcodeblock %}
My favorite thing about Google Web Fonts is that every single font in the library is Open Source. "This means that you are free to share your favorites with friends and colleagues. You can even customize them for your own use, or collaborate with the original designer to improve them. And you can use them in every way you want, privately or commercially â€” in print, on your computer, or in your websites."</br>
