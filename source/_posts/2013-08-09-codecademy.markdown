As a designer I have come across many forms of online learning, some good most bad. When I say "bad", I simply mean they didn't work for ME. Most online learning out there for design or programming is under the "learn by watching model", your basically watching someone do something you want to do. This can work, if the instructor is disecting the things he/she is doing, and if the decisions that are being made are being explained. Even learning service like Lynda can only do so much for me. Lynda was great for me early on when I wanted to learn more about Adobe programs, but when it came down to fundementals I hit a wall. It was kinda the same thing for me when trying to learn how to write code. I go to school for Graphic Design, and most of the programming I know has been self taught, either through books or sites like Lynda.

When I came across Codecademy it was suprisingly refreshing. I decided to start the Jquery courses and just see how it stuck. From the first lesson, I was actually writing code, and the way it works is you have to write code to move on to the next course. They explain not only what your doing, but WHY your doing it. The other big thing that worked for me, was they make you use the things you are lerning rite away. All in all I think Codecademy is a refreshing learning tool for the programming and design world, and I think that it has a lot of room for growth.
