Web frameworks have become a huge trend in the past few years. Most people out there know Twitter's Bootstrap, but that's just the tip of the ice berg. The problem with so many coming out so often is, it's hard to keep track of all of them. I'm going to be honest, most of the frameworks coming out don't really offer that much more than something like Bootstap, or Foundation. There are however some pretty neat framworks that do offer something different than all the others out there. I've compiled a list of about 12 frameworks, I've chose these through my own experience and research.
